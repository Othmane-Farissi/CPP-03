## About

This project contains a series of exercises and implementations exploring C++ topics such as:
- Classes and inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Operator overloading
- Memory management
- Exception handling
- Advanced C++ features

The exercises are designed to be modular and independent, allowing focused learning and experimentation.

## Features

- Well-documented C++ code
- Modular exercise folders
- Example implementations of classic and advanced OOP concepts
- Demonstrates best practices for C++ development

## Project Structure

The repository may contain multiple folders, each representing separate exercises or modules. Example structure:

```
CPP-03/
├── ex00/
├── ex01/
├── ex02/
├── ex03/
├── ...
└── README.md
```

Each `exXX` folder contains source code, headers, and sometimes test files for the respective exercise.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Othmane-Farissi/CPP-03.git
   cd CPP-03
   ```

2. **Build the exercises**
   Each exercise typically includes a Makefile for easy compilation. For example, to build `ex00`:
   ```bash
   cd ex00
   make
   ```

3. **Run the executable**
   ```bash
   ./<executable_name>
   ```

## Usage

- Review the README or comments in each exercise folder for specific instructions.
- Compile and run each module independently.
- Modify and extend the code to experiment with C++ features.
